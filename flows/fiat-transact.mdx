Allows users to fund on-chain transactions directly from their bank account. 

### How does it work?

When a user interacts with your application and initiates a transaction, the Peaze widget prompts them with the following steps:
1. View transaction details such as price, fees, slippage, etc.
2. (One time step) Connect bank account.
3. Confirm the payment and transaction.

The Peaze SDK then interacts with the user's connected wallet to collect the necessary signatures. 
Once these signatures are collected and the transaction is confirmed, the following steps take place:

1. The transaction signature that the user generated is temporarily stored client-side with the Peaze SDK. 
2. Peaze on-ramps the necessary funds into the user's wallet. 
3. Peaze broadcasts the transaction from step 1 upon receiving confirmation of the on-ramp's completion.
