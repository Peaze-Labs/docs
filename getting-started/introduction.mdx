Peaze is a developer SDK that automates web3 complexities so your users can fund on-chain transacations with ease. 

By working alongside your existing integrations (like Wagmi and RainbowKit) Peaze streamlines your dApp's transaction experience to enable the following flows for your users:
- [Fiat transact](/flows/fiat-transact): User connects their bank account and confirms the transaction. Peaze automates all necessary on-ramping and swapping.
- [Crypto transact](/flows/crypto-transact) (coming soon): User specifies the token to transact with and confirms the transaction. Peaze automates all necessary bridging and swapping.
